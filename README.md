# Pocket Boss Fighter BE
## WIP
Pocket Boss Fighter will be a turn-based boss battle rpg.

The game will be a full-stack, multiplayer browser game. The current plan for multiplayer implementation is using Websockets for player differentiation, in order to achieve a, "Jackbox" style multiplayer system, in which one player hosts the game, and then other players simply use a room code to join, no accounts or sign in needed.

This is the backend repository for this project.
